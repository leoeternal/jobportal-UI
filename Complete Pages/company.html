              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a
                thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific main point.
                Whereas the thesis is the main point of the essay, the topic
                sentence is the main point of the paragraph. Like the thesis
                statement, a topic sentence has a unifying function. But a
                thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee
                unity. An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate to the
                thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences
                relate to the topic sentence. Note: Not all paragraphs need
                topic sentences. In particular, opening and closing paragraphs,
                which serve different functions from body paragraphs, generally
                don’t have topic sentences.
              </p>
